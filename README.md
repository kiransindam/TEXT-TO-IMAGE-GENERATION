# TEXT-TO-IMAGE-GENERATION
Features

Text-to-Image Transformation: Generate high-quality images from textual descriptions.
Cutting-Edge Deep Learning: We harness the latest advancements in deep learning, powered by PyTorch, to create our models.
Open-Source: This project is open for collaboration and welcomes contributions from the community.
Easy Setup: Simple installation steps and clear usage instructions make it accessible to all.
Customization: Fine-tune parameters to create a wide array of images to suit your needs.

Libraries Used
Our project relies on a powerful set of libraries to make text-to-image generation possible:

mediapy: Manipulate images and videos, enabling dynamic content creation.
torch: The PyTorch framework serves as the backbone for our deep learning models.
sys: Essential for system-level operations and interactions.
DiffusionPipeline: Enhances data preprocessing and augmentation.
random: Injects randomness into the generation process, fostering diversity in the output.

Getting Started
(1) Clone this Repository
          git clone https://github.com/kiransindam/TEXT-TO-IMAGE-GENERATION.git
(2) Install Required Libraries
        pip install -r requirements.txt 
(3) Generate Images from Text
  Prepare your text data in a file.
     Run the Text-to-Image Generator:
          python generate_images.py --input input.txt --output output_/
 --input: Path to your text file.
--output: Directory to save the generated images.
Voil√†! Witness your textual descriptions come to life as beautiful images.
